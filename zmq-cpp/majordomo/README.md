# Majordomo

I want the client message can be routing to a specific worker. for example, if I have water/tea/coffee three workers at the same time, a client can send a message to tea-worker, and the tea-worker would give the client a 'tea' reply; when the client send a message to a non-exists worker, a timeout would reached.
